It was named after Benigno "Ninoy" Aquino, Jr. The Ninoy Aquino Parks & Wildlife Center has a lagoon, an aquarium, a playground, botanical garden and a Wildlife Rescue Center, which the Department of Environment and Natural Resources uses as a temporary shelter where confiscated, retrieved, donated, sick, abandoned, and injured wild animals are placed to be taken care of.

         <h2>History</h2>
         <div class="img_container">
            <p>The history of the Ninoy Aquino Parks and Wildlife Center (NAPWC) can be traced back to 1954, when the Quezon Memorial Park was established through Proclamation No. 42 issued during the administration of President Ramon Magsaysay. The site of the current NAPWC was included inside this park. The park's area was reduced in 1968 and 1969 with land reallocated for use of the national government and the Philippine Science High School. The NAPWC was opened on July 25, 1970 after it was inaugurated by then-President Ferdinand Marcos. As early as the 1970s, the park also hosted a conventional mini zoo which also served a dual role of depository of wild animals rescued or turned-over to the park by private owners.</p>
